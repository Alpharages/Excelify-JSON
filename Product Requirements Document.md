# Product Requirements Document

## Objective:

Create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly API service that converts Excel files of varying formats and sizes into structured JSON, providing essential metadata for simplified data integration and analytics.

## Target Audience:

- Software Developers
- Data Analysts
- Business Intelligence Teams
- Internal and External Application Integrators

## Functional Requirements:

### Core Features:

- **File Upload**: Support Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) via multipart/form-data.
- **Excel Parsing**: Accurately parse and process data from all sheets within the uploaded Excel file.
- **JSON Output**: Return structured JSON data organized by sheet name.
- **Metadata Provision**: Include metadata such as sheet names, total rows, and column headers.

### API Specification:

- **Endpoint**: POST `/api/excel-to-json`
- **Input Parameter**:
  - `excelFile`: Excel file upload
- **Response**:
  - JSON object containing metadata and data for each sheet.

### Error Handling:

- Validation of file type and integrity.
- Clear, descriptive error messages for missing or invalid inputs.
- Server-side exception management and logging.

## Non-functional Requirements:

### Performance:

- Efficient handling of large file sizes (up to 50MB recommended).
- Response time optimized for user experience (<3 seconds for typical file sizes).

### Security:

- File type validation (restrict to `.xlsx`, `.xls`).
- Optional malware scanning integration.
- Use security middleware (e.g., Helmet).
- Adherence to secure coding practices to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Scalability:

- Scalable infrastructure deployment (cloud-based, containerized via Docker).

### Usability:

- Clear API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Example use cases and request/response examples.

## Technology Stack:

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Libraries**: `xlsx`, `multer`, `cors`, `helmet`
- **Deployment Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Heroku, Docker

## Acceptance Criteria:

- Successfully converts various Excel files into accurate JSON structures.
- Provides accurate and complete metadata.
- Robust handling of errors and edge cases.
- Maintains performance standards across varying file sizes.

## Development Timeline:

- Prototype Development: 2 weeks
- Internal Testing & Iterations: 1 week
- Deployment & Security Validation: 1 week
- Documentation & Final Review: 3 days

## Success Metrics:

- API adoption rate
- User feedback and satisfaction
- Performance metrics adherence (response time, uptime)
- Reduction in manual processing time for target user groups
