# Technical Document

#### Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation details, architecture, and system components for the Excel-to-JSON API service, designed to convert Excel spreadsheet files into structured JSON format efficiently.

#### Architecture

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express.js (typsecript)
- **Libraries**:
  - `xlsx` for parsing Excel files
  - `multer` for handling file uploads
  - `cors` for cross-origin resource sharing
  - `helmet` for enhancing security
- **Deployment**: Cloud-based deployment (AWS, Azure, Heroku), containerization via Docker

#### API Structure

##### Endpoint:

```
POST /api/excel-to-json
```

##### Request Format:

- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Field: `excelFile` (Excel file in `.xlsx` or `.xls` format)

##### Response Structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "totalSheets": 2,
    "sheetNames": ["Sheet1", "Sheet2"],
    "sheets": {
      "Sheet1": { "totalRows": 10, "columns": ["Column1", "Column2"] },
      "Sheet2": { "totalRows": 5, "columns": ["ColumnA", "ColumnB"] }
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "Sheet1": [{ "Column1": "Value", "Column2": "Value" }],
    "Sheet2": [{ "ColumnA": "Data", "ColumnB": "Data" }]
  }
}
```

#### Technical Flow

1.  **File Upload and Validation**:
    - Receives file through HTTP POST request.
    - Uses `multer` to securely handle and store uploaded file temporarily in memory.
    - Validates file extension (`.xlsx` or `.xls`).
2.  **Excel File Processing**:
    - Parses file buffer using `xlsx` library.
    - Iterates through each sheet, converting data into JavaScript objects.
3.  **JSON Conversion**:
    - Transforms sheet data into structured JSON format.
    - Generates metadata including sheet names, row count, and column headers.
4.  **Error Handling**:
    - Implements robust exception management.
    - Provides clear error messages and HTTP status codes (400, 500).

#### Security Measures

- Utilizes `helmet` middleware for setting secure HTTP headers.
- Restricts file types strictly to Excel formats.
- Optional integration with malware scanning services for enhanced security.

#### Deployment Strategy

- Deploys via containerization (Docker) for scalability and ease of maintenance.
- Cloud deployment options include AWS EC2, Azure App Services, or Heroku.

#### Performance Considerations

- Efficient parsing and memory management to handle files of varying sizes.
- Ensures low latency response for optimal user experience.

#### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Implements logging for monitoring request/response cycles and error tracking.
- Regular updates and security patching to maintain service reliability and security.

#### Documentation

- Comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI standards.
- Includes usage examples and response samples for easy developer integration.

#### Future Enhancements

- Adding asynchronous job processing for extremely large files.
- Enhancing security with automated malware detection integrations.
- Expanding API analytics and usage monitoring capabilities.
